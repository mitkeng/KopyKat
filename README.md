User-Friendly Peptide Conformation Generation 

This python language platform takes in a peptide pdb file and generates conformations using the openMM molecular dynamics software. In addition, general molecules or nonstandard peptides can also be applicable provided that they have customized force fields. One avenue to generate a custom force field is through [LigParGen](http://zarbi.chem.yale.edu/ligpargen/index.html). KopyKat was created through google Colab, so the program may operate more smoothly in Colab than in Jupyter. Click [KopyKat](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XQFpyve_QcMWBQvyLV5kEpLgzbhqpeO9#scrollTo=x15w2e0-NSgB) to access the Colab notebook version.
